This project aims to emulate the PlayStation&trade; 1 console in an accurate
fashion. No hacks or shortcuts will be used to accomplish this goal. Everything
needed will be provided by default, this means there aren't any plug-ins to
locate, maintain, or configure.

## Current Status

Currently, the emulator is capable of booting a small amount of commercial
games with compatibility constantly evolving.

## Usage

The emulator requires a BIOS file, which can be dumped from a physical console.

Once you have a BIOS file, PSXACT can be invoked via command line, using the
following simple interface:

```
$ psxact <bios file here> <game file here>
```

## Building

This project uses CMake for builds, and requires SDL2.
